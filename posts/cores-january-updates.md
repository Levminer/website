Here's a summary of the items that were shipped this month.

## What's Cores?

Cores is a hardware monitor background service with remote connection support and a modern UI. With Cores, you can monitor temperature sensors, fan speeds, voltages, load sensors, and clock speeds. It allows you to view detailed information about your motherboard, CPU, GPU, RAM, BIOS, drives, fans, monitors, and network interfaces. Additionally, Cores enables you to monitor your system remotely from anywhere using a web browser.

## Changelog

-   macOS version: The macOS version is now in beta. Give it a try on your old Mac mini that's lying in the corner.
-   Export data: On the Pro plan, you can now export data from Cores as a .csv file or save the charts, so you can brag to your friends about how cold your CPU is or that you have 1 gigabit fiber.
-   Linux daemon: You can now run coresd on Linux as a daemon, so if you restart your computer, Cores will start monitoring automatically.
-   Hardware monitoring updates: Ryzen 9000, Lunar Lake, and Arrow Lake CPUs are now supported.
-   Login improvements and cloud sync: You can now log in with your Google account to sync codes between computers.
